# Data Science for All - Team 42


Weavers Way is a member-owned cooperative grocery with locations in Northwest Philadelphia and Ambler, Pennsylvania. They offer a friendly shopping environment and reasonably priced, high-quality products that are local, sustainable, organic, fairly traded and healthful. Like many other retailers food retailers, Weavers Way desires to diversify its supply chain with a focus on patronizing businesses owned by racial minorities. 

Our solution is to find and visualize demographic data about local food growers, vendors & producers and to create a searchable database for department buyers and customers to browse when choosing what products to buy or when requesting that the Coop add new product offerings. The visualizations will give much needed context on the racial demographics of the market of local food producers, and the database will enhance current practices + allow the coop to save time while also taking a more proactive approach to identifying new vendors.
